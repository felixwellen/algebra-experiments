# Experiments with basic algebra

This project is about entertaining myself with some basic algebra and eventually checking out some ideas of David Jaz Myers and Ingo Blechschmidt.

The code uses cubical agda, which is not essential so far except for the Hit in 'HornerPolynomial.agda' and 'FreeAlgebra.agda'.
